LeaderBoard - problem was to create a class with method which gets two lists as an input:
- ranked list which is a list of scores 
- player list which is a list of scores of out player
The tsak was to return a list consisting of rank of a player scores from a leaderboard
The following assumptions have been made:
- rank of player with top score is 1
- if two player has the same score then they have the same rank and next person with lower score has rank increased by 1
